\section{Application Overview}
For our final project, we decided to build a web application for Mines students
to show off their cool projects on the ACM TV in Brown Building West. We call
the application \app after the age-old first-grade tradition. The core
functionality \app is that users can create teams and upload projects. These
projects are then verified by an system administrator, and once verified, the
projects are ready for display on the ACM TV.

% TODO: Sam, flesh this out

\subsection{Application Schema}
The core entities in our application are users, teams, and projects. In addition
to these entities, \app tracks user sessions and project assets. The following
ERD (Figure~\ref{fig:erd}) describes the relationships between these entities.

% TODO: Sumner, make nicer ERD diagram
